In today's era, technology can enhance human life. Technology is evolving decade by decade. Automation was a science fiction earlier but not today. By combining latest technology with home, we can build an awesome home. With the Arduino uno and Windows 10, we can build a home automation system that is capable of operating home devices automatically.![WhatsApp Image 2022-02-20 at 10 07 32 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98831387/154854748-541ca0d7-03d0-4c84-9d27-0e953ca071f0.jpeg)
COMPONENTS REQUIRED

PIR-The pin configuration of the PIR sensor is shown in the figure. PIR sensor consists of three pins, ground, signal, and power at the side or bottom. Generally, the PIR sensor power is up to 5V, but, the large size PIR modules operate a relay instead of direct output.
HC-05 (Bluetooth)-To make a link between your Arduino and bluetooth, do the following: 1) Go to the bluetooth icon, right click and select Add a Device 2) Search for new device, Our bluetooth module will appear as HC-05, and add it 3) The pairing code will be 1234. 4)after make a pairing, we can now program the arduino and upload a sketch to send or receive data from Computer.![WhatsApp Image 2022-02-20 at 10 50 04 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98831387/154855490-a9da393b-e0ee-4791-8782-0b1a398cffc5.jpeg)
